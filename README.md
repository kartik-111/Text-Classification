In the training data three categories are present: Computational Linguistics, Information Theory, and Computer Vision. An article may encompass any combination of these topics, ranging from all three, any pair, a single subject, or potentially none.
In this project I have used Gradient Boosting Classifier as an showcase of Statistical Method of classification and Recursive Neural Networks ( RNN's). For both the the classification techniques two seperate text-preprocessing have been used and the size of the training data has been adjusted to check the effect of these parameters on our respective models. A total of 48 combinations have been generated, 24 for each model; their F1, precision, recall and accuracy have been claculated and a precison-recall curve generated to find the most effective model.
